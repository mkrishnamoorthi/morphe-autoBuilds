This repository provides full first-class integration with [**Obtainium**](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium), allowing you to install and automatically receive daily background updates for any or all apps directly from GitHub Releases with zero manual downloads.

#### Option 1: 1-Click Single App Install
Click the **Add to Obtainium** badge for any app in the catalog below on your Android device (with Obtainium installed). Obtainium will automatically open with the exact repository, APK filter regex, and version extractor preconfigured!

#### Option 2: Bulk Import All Apps
To import the entire curated catalog at once:
1. Open **Obtainium** on your Android device.
2. Tap the **+** button (or navigate to **Import / Export**) $\\rightarrow$ select **Import from URL**.
3. Paste the configuration URL:
   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashrajrocxx/Mophe-AutoBuilds/main/obtainium.json
   ```
4. Tap **Import**. All apps will be added to your Obtainium database and will automatically track daily releases.

> [!NOTE]
> **User Control & Local State:**
> In Obtainium, importing an app or the `obtainium.json` bundle adds the configuration to your device's local database. It is **not** a forced synchronization—you retain full freedom to install, delete, pause, or pin whichever apps you choose."""
